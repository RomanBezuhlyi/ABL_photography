              Once your newborn is here, we suggest having someone contact us
              immediately so we can choose a date for your session. To insure
              the sleepy, curly, newborn poses, we advise scheduling a newborn
              session within the first 14 days after delivery. Parents of
              breastfed babies should wait until the mother’s milk comes in so
              your newborn will be sure to have a nice full tummy after every
              feeding (about 7-10 days). Bottle fed babies generally take more
              per feeding so may be photographed as early as 4-5 days old.

              Between soothing, precise posing, feeding, and setting up/prepping
              our shots, our newborn photography sessions take about 3 hours.
              Multiple newborns may take a little bit longer. We love taking our
              time to perfect every picture we create.

              We put together a set of guidelines that can help your newborn
              session go as smooth as possible. You will receive it the day
              before your session.

              Yes. We focus on the baby at the beginning of the session and take
              sibling and family portraits at the end of the session. We
              recommend bringing siblings for the last hour of your 3 hour
              studio session. So, they dont have to sit in the studio for the
              whole 3 hour session.
