                “Trusting someone with my newborn and maternity photos is not
                something I take lightly. One of my friends recommended Svetlana
                and she exceeded my expectations in every aspect. She is so fun
                to work with and put me at ease through each shoot. She handled
                my fussy newborn with such care and ease for her photo session
                which really reflected in the photos. The entire experience
                working with her was seamless. She was extremely flexible,
                considering that we did not know exactly when the baby would be
                born. And finally, the quality of the photos were EXCELLENT. We
                loved her classic, elegant style. She is the best newborn
                photographer in San Diego. We are so happy with the final
                product and will recommend her to all our friends!”

                “Choosing a newborn photographer can be extremely overwhelming
                and Svetlana was the best decision we've made when planning for
                the arrival of our little princess. If you are looking for a
                fantastic newborn photographer, stop looking, you've found her!
                I booked her when I was near my due date and knew she was the
                right choice after reviewing her websites (Yelp, Instagram,
                Google, Facebook). Svetlana was very accommodating and
                responsive to my messages on Instagram and Yelp. She has a
                beautiful studio in her home in San Diego with a breathtaking
                set-up and just a ton of wonderful props, backdrops, blankets,
                etc. to use. Svetlana and her assistant were very patient and
                soothing with our newborn. I had absolutely no idea how the
                shoots were going to go and was worried my baby wouldn't
                cooperate, but I was totally wrong as she is truly a baby
                whisperer! I can't say enough about Svetlana and her assistant.
                We are so happy that we found ABL Photography while scouring the
                internet for the best newborn photographers in San Diego. We got
                many compliments already on our daughter's pictures. Newborn
                session is indeed an investment, but working with Svetlana and
                receiving such a high-end product makes it well worth it. If you
                are looking for maternity or newborn photographer Svetlana is
                the best in San Diego, she knows what she is doing!”

                Returning to ABL Photography for our newborn session with our
                second baby was an absolute joy and a decision we're immensely
                grateful for! After an amazing experience with our first baby's
                photos, it was a no-brainer to trust Svetlana and her team once
                again. And this time around, it was even more special.What made
                this experience truly remarkable was seeing both of our babies
                posed in similar setups, creating a beautiful visual connection
                between them despite the three-year age gap. It was an
                incredibly heartwarming sight to witness—our babies looking like
                twins in those captured moments.Svetlana's talent shines not
                only in her ability to capture timeless images but also in her
                wonderful demeanor with kids. Our older daughter adored her
                newborn photos printed on wooden blocks on our walls. She was
                beyond excited to meet the photographer responsible for those
                cherished memories. Svetlana's kind and patient nature
                immediately put our older daughter at ease, especially when she
                was a bit shy at the beginning of the session.One of the most
                precious moments during the shoot was when Svetlana posed our
                older daughter nose to nose with her new baby sister. That
                particular shot is now an absolute favorite of ours,
                encapsulating the sibling bond in a way that words can't
                describe.The compliments we've received on our baby's newborn
                photos have been overwhelming. People can't stop raving about
                how unique and breathtaking the images turned out to be. It's a
                testament to Svetlana's artistry and dedication to her craft.If
                you're in search of the best newborn photographer in San Diego,
                look no further than Svetlana at ABL Photography. Her ability to
                create not just photographs but cherished memories is unmatched.
                We are beyond grateful for the priceless images she has captured
                for our growing family and highly recommend her to everyone
                seeking beautiful and timeless newborn photography.

                If you're searching for the absolute best maternity and newborn
                photographer in San Diego, look no further! My experience with
                Svetlana for both my maternity and newborn photo sessions was
                beyond amazing. From start to finish, it was an exceptional
                journey.During the maternity shoot Svetlana, along with her
                talented assistant, ensured every little detail was perfect.
                They knew exactly how to make me feel relaxed and beautiful,
                capturing stunning moments that I'll cherish forever. The posing
                guidance was fantastic, resulting in breathtaking maternity
                photos that exceeded my expectations.But it was the newborn
                session that truly blew me away. The studio's serene environment
                instantly calmed my little one, and Svetlana's expertise in
                handling my newborn was remarkable. Watching her delicately pose
                my fresh bundle of joy was an art form in itself. Her attention
                to detail, from adjusting tiny fingers to ensuring the perfect
                angle, was nothing short of incredible.What truly sets Svetlana
                apart is her dedication to perfection. She didn't rush through
                any moment; instead, she took the time needed to create magic.
                Her patience and gentle approach with my newborn made all the
                difference, resulting in a collection of images that melted my
                heart.I can't recommend ABL Photography highly enough to all
                expectant parents looking for the best newborn photography
                studio in San Diego. Their professionalism, attention to detail,
                and ability to capture these precious moments are unparalleled.
                Trust me, your baby will be in good hands!
